# Advanced-Distance-Converter
I have made a change in a simple  miles to kilometers converter using javascript in a pre defined HTML and CSS code for the converter.
This change comes with the provision by the user to convert either Miles to Kilometers or Kilometers to Miles just be pressing a key on their keyboard
('M' for Miles to Kilometers and 'K' for Kilometers to Miles).

I used the knowledge I gained from the 'Javascript Basics' course on Coursera provided by University of California,Davis in order to make it.

The CSS style used and HTML code are also provided separately and all three are linked together.
